DREAM LEVEL EMIT LEAVES NOT SPARKS
WHEN DODGE FROM FALLING DO AN ACTION ROLL


--FIX VIBRATE
--UP PURPLE VIBRATES


--todo
--if not in the air then some kind of unblocking animation
--apple w is window close
--SHAEZ TIED TO RUMBLE?!?!?!?


--COUNTER SOUND EFFECT

--can climb if at corner

--the reason vein transparency works the way it does is the trail!!!!
--To do real transparency you have to blend it into the skin color not make it transparent
--green creature emits more sparks, more damage?

--rubble and glass making it mor esparse is based on modulo, but should be on modulo of first digit not the whole number


--dull gold color
--bright blue

--new wall jump
--WIGGLE GET OUT OF FLINCH FASTER
--if xx.v/minit < ratio then no a
--
--SEARCH IS THIS NECESSARY?
--superjump? 
--superJumpRatio = 1.4
--slowmo on non glass things etc, library above the wall thingy where the bolts get stuck
--throw is a little too hard and uneven in distrribution
--green punch not working great
--beast mode, switch between beasts by alternating which is held?

--hug button
--chrome/metallic so as to suit monochromaticity
--motion blur






--PARALX ZOOMS OUT SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY TO CAMERA ZOOM

--if you use one color too long you start to turn that color and have permanent those effects?  or you burn out?s
--or you take up to double damage? become fragile, but stronger?

--if landing lower the num of frames on the pre fall back
--fix zoomout relative to distance slight jump

--placement of cam funcs causes weirdness for actionshot
--cant move right while sliding left?  pretty easy to do with base/push




--do special features to second pp, shake if on plat and near, send person through plat if not floor
--make spikes not be on not ground
--front paralax?
--anytime glassbreak then slowmo
--if combo swap, still does follow through of that color, easy fix
--make purple spike combo quicker
--string together combos not desigining each ocmbination
--quickfix - bump allows you to pull people if walk in while in their box
--holding down attack makes it repeat the attack, make you have to reset to center
--doing kick as p2 makes you look like p1????
--dodgeturn around is faster than dodge...
--make it so that turnaound doesn't add V!!!!!, maybe it does it with a low v if you do it late as opposed to not permitting you to do it if it's late, add time but let v stay or even slow down if anything 
--if during the dodge whatsitcalled forward and delay, stay in a certain image?
--fix make it so that animate follows through even if BB isn't yeah
--allow faster punchs
--fix dodge
--fix flinch? make it one at least
--make vibration a function, give it parameters of duration and intensity
--at end of each update then call joystickvibrate else throw to vibrate function/variables
--maybe left stick can control purple spike direction

--on up attack, can jump in the air during combo window
--when negative 1 hum sound hold on the changetocolor but when it hits do a ding
--some water effects would be awesome
--smooth slowmo, each frame split it up before going to next, when applying v to x, split it up depending on how many slwo mini frames, apply to drawn stuff
--maybe color should just be transparent and vary that rather than color
--in case it bugs, have a temp balue each frame that resets to zero once the actual number is added on
--maybe default color is gray, not white
--general rule - attacks that take in an input (you.v) vs just outputting something offer my dynamicism, even if not immediately apparent
--make joystick 
--ON COMBO CINEMATIC, PITCH CHANGE, COLOR CHANGE, ZOOM OUT A BIT
--SPARKS COLOR BASED ON ATTACK COLOR?!?!?!?!?!?
--mine throw lob doesn't explode until activated on ground
--dodge slide turn around speed not the same as slide, it's faster
--ON HIT GLASS/WALL WHILE FLINCHED OR BOUNCE OFF EDGE WALL SLOW DOWN TIME OR PAUSE
--if chargin up then time slows or stops, easy combo chain, camera zoom too? then zoom back out, the color hums




--maybe if slow then walkrate decreases so you can walk slowly if using controller
--plane overhead night city veins simmulator for loading screens? or just a scene

--allow bounce off purple at high speeds like flinch off walls?
--adjust vroom so that it slows down to the speed limit on approach
--camera jumping alignment isn't right, test based on both on middle platform, jump up with one
--dodge is click in on run, roll down then direction (if down and right or left)
--make speed change on dis greater slower at yeah
--block is run click and down
--paper makes a sound
--debug shows healths and ft etc.
--if me.im dodgefoward and ft causes knockback, straight to back
--AIR PURPLE ON THE UPPER EDGE OF THE LIBRARY, THE BOUNDARY, DOESN'T WORK BLEH MAKE A BETTER FUNCTION DUDE, LIKE A WHEREISFLOOR FUNCTION AND PLUG THE PURP THROUGH THAT THEN - TO GET PROPER Y HEIGHT
--glass and wall breaking work on hc, and like the dis between the two inter points causes the h to be yeah, careful of like... people though, those objects, especially a vertical line.  hm.  
--green isn't working with ghc?
--SOUND WHEN FULLY CHARGED AND YOU HAVE TO SLAM DOWN, ELSE CANCEL
--maybe each color while holding has a tone, the sound version of the color's waelength?
--control stuff can be just one and apply to c1 and c2
--fix chain grab, it makes sound when hit wall, doesnt dissear if no hit, should instant stop if hit wall? yeah.
--maybe all rectangles/shapes, no lines, if hit walls  -
--make walls a hittable hc thing
--  -then do like, the dist between the two hitty things causes how much bla to be release with a minimum of 1.
--bolts can hit other bolts? knock them out of the air?
--condense controller to just one function applied to controllers
--Tie health to color of crest, gets black
--for buttons http://love2d.org/wiki/love.keypressed
--glass&rubble flies out too fast, make it like 3/4 of me.v
--blue would be cool
--dude make walls organized like floors
--add some grab only ledges, like the streetlights and the billboard
--if not one screen then slowly decrease health?
--so moveme i made into better justo ne function, do that for all i guess, make the yctt's whatever a you.ctt
--illusory bolt, forms a whole bunch but only one of them is real, the rest or other is just a reflection
--animal color, become the emobidment of the other things?  Or as a special special?
--should the edges induce a camera stop?  Why did I stop doing that?
--deadly attack if hit major damage, if miss, super exposed, can't do any other attacks for a bit?
--cloud maker would be cool, maybe like a bunch of semitransparent square in a random distribution
--if falling and time the dodge you can do a roll land, if it follows qualifications of needing to crouch
--one of the charge attacks lets you snipe by doing the above, sloep of x and y of stick
--maybe do like, the black attack hits and hten throws in a direction?
--for mines hc, dir is -you.lr? but what about them sliding backwards into it while blocking?
--above the rightmost rafter there seems tobe an invisible grabbale edge
--FOR SLOWMO if love.timer then love.timer.sleep(1/60) end
--have greenwallbreaks tied in volume to dis like purp use math.min
---maybe if at edge and other direction then stop?
--error in shaking cam when top and bottom cam?
--leafs from trees like paper from office
--incentive to attack after elapsed time, so game doesn't last forever
--flick vs the select and trigger control mechanisms
--flapping allows you to move freely in air?
--have gamespeed variable and attach it to sounds
--MAKE MASKS ON THE BLACK BAR
--climb then hold down and block is weird
--no crest on running
--sound for spines passing by?
--have leaves come out of trees like paper
--if approach edge of a floor, climb up it, or if flinched, bounce off? or not.... maybe just fall through

--can aim the green sand upwards
--more paralx?  and blur it
--ding/sound for fully charged of an attack?
--fix tornado by having wind hits halve your movement?
--im for running through wall/ glass ( or maybe only wall)
--dodge then hold run and move right, it goes weird
--make flinch sound more solid
--why is there that one stray color in the spine when they separate??
--also have a special case fo rwall jumping off edge barriers? or...
--standardize the barriers
--grapple function? it's click in on right stick and move in a direction
--an attack that really incorporates movement into it
--MAYBE make it so that color selection is the right stick but you need to use the trigger to actually use it
--if big flinch then shake screen a little mor maybe?
--big fall over should knock you off the ground, the image should be off the ground slightly
--shake from running?
--option to turn color ring on or off 
--if you do tornado, if the guy is poulled through it he pops back out the other side and repeats, also make it launch you up more
--grappling hook is looking a bit odd when reeling
--color that creates drones?  Or drones are like colored A's


--maybe vine or whatever, anyway, a poison attack that makes you weaker to other attacks
--while bla do, else do increase increment by the value of the array that we're on, is that random?  or something?  multiply it by?
--allow blue up air reset if you wall jump?
--warping color from blue to white is awesome
--one of the colors gives you a streak of you's like right behind, a ribbon
--one of the elec attacks an elec beam that randomly runs around, no controlling it, line segments grows in random direction
--why does spine add a third color sometime, like a lone blue thing moving down the spine
--select color with face buttons, direct attack/use with right stick?
--flinchdir is different when it's a mine or purples from a distance or grappling hook etc, maybe implement flinch dir
--if approach a corner just hope onto it naturall contextually
--why does a third color appear in the spine?
--fallforward face is slightly off
--is green purp decrease too small?
--pause doesnt stop tornado
--special image for jumping through a ceiling or through a wall
--running and green is not animated
--charge purple than dodge
--sprint function shakes screen?
--maybe do stuff with dt
--an attack that causes self damage too, maybe the elec one
--bug that reset characters on library, p1
--Also maybe make ynl and mnl work based on velocity
--some attacks lower gravity or something
--purple climbs up rafters
--Charge attack if it's a charge then me.charge and also you have to flip the stick in the opposite direction for it to work!



--colorcontrol, go, size,MODE


--when dead, flash white, background cuts to black, characters are stark white



--sound for bolt whiffing by?
--assign mecolor and youcolor to the a's, a1, a2 etc
--HAVE A RUN FUNCTION? CANT ATTACK BUT RUN FASTER?

--HEY, MAYBE MAKE IT SO THAT WHEN THE TWO ARE CLOSE ENOUGH IT'S ONE SCREEN AND THEN if the right goes left he takes the left screen over
--have a map with a permanent unmovthroughable wall somewhere in the middle or somethinh

--backgrounds be a bit more fadey?  A tiny bit less color?

--base random seed on movement during one part?  or have it be entered, or just time spent on opening screen

--iphone bluetooth controller?


--if a12 then in that function have accomodations for dont let go of this module until there are no buttons pressed!!!!!!
--check for a1 and a2
--if a1 and a2 then bla if a1 then bla else nokeys, use this to identify for the above command






--when flinch background frame turns white?
--PAPER PHYSICS
--SPEED LOWERS AS THEY GET CLOSER, maybe towards is also faster hypotenuse of x-x y-y 
--fall damage?
--one attack does more damage the longer its in the air
--have the 12:00 flash
--charge punch off screen doesnt hit wall
--dodge and stick arm air slowdown
--special barry final attack
