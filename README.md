# ADA

Ada is a combinatorial, super powered 2d brawler set in large pixely New York city scapes.




Ada is a game I've been working on for about two years now.  It's currently in a state of huge upheaval as I attempt to turn it from a messy side project to a well documented and efficient game.

I do the art, programming, music and story for it, so development can be a bit slow.

For questions suggestions comments, whatever, email me at checkeredlines@gmail.com
