Ada is a two player highly combinatorial super powered brawler set in sweeping cityscapes with deep controls.

I do the art, programming, music and story for it, so development can be a bit slow, I've been working on for about two years now, but it's just reached a point a where the combat portion of the game can be downloaded and played over at the website!  Holy cow!
